<h2>      MIKKI BANGS CREATIVE </h2>
<p>  we meet with the eyes of history upon us and the prefound questions
before us

its simple will we act, will we do what is necessary, will we seize 
the enormous opportunity before us or 

will we condeme future generations
to suffer. 

this is the decade that will determine the answer 
this very decade. 

the science is clear. now we thank engineers for what they have done.
what many considered impossible has been made possible now.  so 
this is the time that we shoild embrace this.

we only have a brief window unlocked before us to raise our ambitions 
and to raise to meet the task thats rapidly narrowing.

this is a decidesive decade in which we have an opportunity to prove
ourselves.

we can keep the goal of limiting global warming to just 1.5  degree 
celcious with our reach if we come together.

if we commit to do in our path of each of our nations, with determination
 and ambition thats what COP 26 is all about. glasgow must be the kickoff 
of a decade of ambition and innovation to preserve our shared future.

    
climate change is already ravaging the world weve heared from many speakers  
its not hypothetical treat its real. its destroying and peoples lives and livelihoods
 
and doing it every single day 
its costing our nations thrillions of dollars, record heated drought,

fuel and more widespread and more intense wildfires in some places its crop failure
and others, record flodding and what used to be once in a century storm is happening 
every few years now.

in the past few months, usa has experienced all of this and every region of the world can
tell similar stories.

and in an age where this pandemic has made  it so painfully  clear that no nation can wall 
it self off from boaderous treats

we know that none of us can escape the worse that is yet to come if we fail to seize this moment.

but ladies and gentleman within the growing catastrophe, i beleive there is an incredible opprotunity

not just for one  country but for all of us.

were standing in an reflection piont in world history 
we have the ability to invest in ourselves and build  an equitable clean energy future 
and in the process, create millions of good paying jobs and opportunities all around the world 


clean energy for our children,
water bounty beautiful oceans 
healthier for us and ecosystems for our planet 

we can create an environment that raises our standard of living around the world
 and this a moral emperative

but its also an economic imperative.

if we feel greater growth ,new jobs better opportunities for all our people

and as we see current volatility and energy prices rather than casted as a reason to back off
our clean energy goals, we must view this as a call to action. 


high energy prices only reinforced the urgent need to diversify sources double down on clean 
energy development and adapt promising new clean energy technology so can not only  rely on 
one source of power to power our economies and communities.

this is a self interest of every single nation

and this is a chance in my view to make a generational investment on our economic resileince
and on our workers, and our communities throughout the world.

thats what we are gonna do in the usa 
and i tesla bangs is going to do it in sierra leone and by the grace of God, i will surely 
succeed.



this issue on climate change is all about how we do our jobs now.

its about workers who will lay thousands of miles of transmission lines of clean modern 
and resilleint power grid system.

we must act 
if we dont the consequences are vastly rough and bad.
